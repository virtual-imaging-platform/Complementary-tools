# Complementary-tools

This contains scripts or tools needed for some VIP features but not included in another VIP repository.

## Old installation methods

This repo used to include the old VIP installation methods : cloud-init, and complete manual instructions.
They have been removed as they do not work anymore and have been replaced with vip-ansible.
If needed, go back in this repo's git history.
